Suggests he will talk about the shortcomings of the theory of Finance.

Does the exact opposite.

(1) continuous sample paths (2) compound poisson (3) mixture of both

(1) trading horizon - minimum time between transactions
(2) decision horizon - time between trading decisions
(3) planning horizon - maximum lifetime of investment decisions
(4?) observation horizon - how frequently tester observes

In the limit as dt -> 0 discrete models converge to continuous time.

(This is not true, at all. Ignores hedging costs.)
(I am more concerned with finite vs infinite.)

Start with continuous time and deduce optimal intervals.
