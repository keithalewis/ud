# Vector Spaces

The _real numbers_, $R$, are a _field_. 

Modern math: rules things satisfy, not what they are.

Modern CS: Stepanov figured out the same thing. (Regular types.)

Hamming: purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.

Me: purpose of math is not proofs but understanding relationships.

$R^n = \{(x_1,\dots,x_n): x_j\in R\}$.

$x + y = (x_1 + y_1, \dots)$

$ax = (a x_1, \dots)$

Exercise. $a(x + y) = ax + ay$.

## Coordinate Free

$W\subset V$, $V/W = ...$.

$T\colon V\to W$

$T\colon V\to V/\ker T\to \ran T\to W$.

Don't need Steinitz Lemma.
